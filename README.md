# FGH Code Repo

This is the Financing Global Health code repository. Please note there are some references in the code to the report year as 2024, but this for internal reasons only and all of the code is indeed for our FGH 2026 report.

The code in FGH_2026\01_research\01_channels creates estimates for the various development aid organizations that we track, which is fed into FGH_2026\01_research\02_compiling to create the final DAH retrospective estimates.  These estimates are fed into the Economic Indicators pipeline to create prospective estimates of DAH along with retrospective and prospective THE (Total Health Expenditure), OOP (Out of Pocket), and GHE (Government Health Expenditure) estimates.
