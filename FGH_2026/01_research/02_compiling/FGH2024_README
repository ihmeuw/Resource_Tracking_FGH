For FGH 2024, 2 major edits:  

- We implemented ad-hoc recipient country updates for the UN channels - due to the late nature of these changes they were added in compiling rather than to the channels. This will certainly not be needed in the future, so the `0b_un_recipient` directory won't be needed and the `4b.2_recip_impute_fgh2024.R` script won't be needed.  

- We also implemented a post-compiling prediction stage which is what the `7b_fgh2024_predict2025plus` directory currently handles. If that doesn't get used in future work, the 7* scripts may need some modification.  

- In general, the 7* scripts provide a new level of standardization for the retrospective data - a more modern version of the ADB PDB designed to be more user friendly and more efficient for common analyses peformed by the team.


See README.md for more details on the traditional compiling pipeline
